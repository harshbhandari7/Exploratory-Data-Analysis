### **Google Playstore Data Case Study**

The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app.

Through EDA, we can answer the following and as well as other inferences -

- Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps? 
- Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?

To perform the analysis, I have used various methods of numpy and pandas like
*mean, median, quantile, qcut, pivot_table* to aggregate and transform the data.

There are different types of visualisation used from libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to infer the data like:

- **Box Plots**
- **Histograms**
- **Distribution Plots**
- **Pie/Bar Charts**
- **Scatter Plots**
- **Joint Plots**
- **Pair Plots**
- **Heatmaps**
- **Line Plots**
- **Stacked Bar Charts**

This folder contains 2 files -

1. **googleplaystore_v2.csv** - Stores data for the playstore apps.
2. **Google_playstore_eda.ipynb** - jupyter notesbook in which EDA is performed.
