### **Google Playstore Data Case Study**

The team at Google Play Store wants to develop a feature that would enable them to boost visibility for the most promising apps. Now, this analysis would require a preliminary understanding of the features that define a well-performing app.

Through EDA, we can answer the following and as well as other inferences -

- Does a higher size or price necessarily mean that an app would perform better than the other apps? 
- Or does a higher number of installs give a clear picture of which app would have a better rating than others?

To perform the analysis, I have used various methods of numpy and pandas like
**mean, median, quantile, qcut, pivot_table** to aggregate and transform the data.
